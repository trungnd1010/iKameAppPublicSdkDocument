## Preconditions

Please ensure, before you jump into the sample code, that you are familiar with the model driven development process in general. You will find further information about that on the following sides:<br>

- [JEAF Generator](../)

- [UML Modelling Guide](/uml-modeling-guide)

<br>

## Download JEAF Generator Sample Project

If you want to work with JEAF Generator we strongly recommend to checkout our sample project. Jumping through the code is a very meaningful thing to do besides reading all the documentation.<br>

- **anaptecs GitHub Repository**  
  Clone latest version directly from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anaptecs/jeaf-generator-samples)

<br>

## Structure of the example project

As you can see in our [Modeling Guide](/uml-modeling-guide) JEAF Generator is able to generate lots of different types of code based on the UML model. To ensure a better overview in the example project we created an independent Maven sub module for every content 
type that will be generated.

**Note:**

* In general the configuration of the sample project is a very good baseline to setup your projects.<br>
  
  However in case of the sample project all output will be written to `src-gen` / `res-gen`. This will ensure that also code / resources that actually are only generated once are always up-to-date. However in real life this is not a good setup as manual code will be overwritten every time JEAF Generator will be executed :wink:

<br>

## UML Model

As mentioned several times before JEAF Generator needs an UML model as input for code generation. This sample project here uses a very simple UML model that was created to demonstrate modeling and code generation. Thus the model concentrates mostly on how to model but not on correct representation of a special business.<br>

Most important parts of the model will be shown here. In addition the sample project also contains the MagicDraw UML project files as well as an HTML export of the model.
