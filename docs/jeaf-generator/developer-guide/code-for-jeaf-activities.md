# Generating Code for JEAF Activities

Activities are used to structure the internal dynamic aspects of a component and help to achieve a better testability.

![Code for Activities](/images/code_for_activities.png)

<br>

Diagram above shows the output that is generated by JEAF Generator from activities (stereotype `«JEAFActivity»`) in the UML model.<br>

- **Activity Interface** (`CreateCustomerActivity`)  
  JEAF Generator will create an activity interface for every activity of from the UML model. This interface will have a single operation with the in- and output parameters according to the model. The interface is not intended to be edited and so it will be written to `src-gen`.  

<br>

- **Activity Implementation** (`CreateCustomerActivityImpl`)  
  JEAF Generator will also generate an implementation class for every activity. This class will implement the activity interface but of course will only have an empty implementation. As this class needs to be implemented it will be written to `src`.
