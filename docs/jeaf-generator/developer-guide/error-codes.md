| `9100` | `Error`   | JEAF Generator expects a specific version of the so called JEAF Meta Model (JMM). The JMM version that is used by your UML model seems to be outdated. Please upgrade to latest version of JMM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `9101` | `Warning` | When working with OpenAPI and REST there are some restrictions concerning the data types that can be used in Java. This warning tells you that in a specific REST operation a incompatible parameter or return type is used. This will lead to an invalid request / response from an OpenAPI perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `9102` | `Warning` | Depending on how you export XMI files from your MagicDraw UML model, it might happen that the files contain information about file systems paths. This should not be an issue on the machine where you exported the files. However, it may lead to problems on other devices or your CI/CD infrastructure where file system paths might not be the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `9103` | `Warning` | When working with OpenAPI and REST there are some restrictions concerning the data types that can be used in Java. This warning tells you that in a defined `«BeanParam»` at least one property uses an incompatible type. This will lead to an invalid request / response from an OpenAPI perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `9104` | `Error`   | When defining the path of a REST resource then the path that is defined on the `«RESTResource»` (not `«RESTOperation»`) must start with a `'/'`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `9105` | `Error`   | The resource path of an `«RESTOperation»` is the combination of the path of the `«RESTResource»` and the `«RESTOperation»`. However at least one of them has to be defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `9106` | `Error`   | The path of a `«RESTOperation»` must not start with `'/'`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `9107` | `Error`   | Each `«RESTOperation»` must define at least one HTTP method. If this message occurs then you have to fix your UML model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `9108` | `Error`   | The `«RESTOperation»` uses a HTTP status code that is not compatible with JAX-RS standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `9109` | `Error`   | The supported consumed media types can either be defined on the `«RESTResource»` or on the `«RESTOperation»` but at least on one of them the information has to be defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `9110` | `Error`   | The produced media types can either be defined on the `«RESTResource»` or on the `«RESTOperation»` but at least on one of them the information has to be defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `9111` | `Error`   | All input parameters of a `«RESTOperation»` must have a name.
