## Generating Code for Object Mappings

JEAF Generator offers the possibility to free developers from error-prawn and boring job of mapping objects from one into another. To do so, a so called object mapping can be defined in the UML model by defining dependencies between attributes using stereotype `«ObjectMapping»`. Object mappings distinguish between creating, updating and reading of objects.<br>

When it comes to code generation JEAF Generator will generate a converter class for every combination of two classes that have an object mapping. The generated code will be written to slot `src-gen` and is not intended for manual editing.

<br>

The generated converter class let’s you:

- create a new target object from an existing source object

- create a new source object an existing target object

- update an existing target object from an existing source object

<br>
