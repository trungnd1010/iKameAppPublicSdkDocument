# How to model POJOs

Stereotype `«POJO»` can be used to model a POJO (Plain old Java object). It depends on your individual programming model what POJOs will be used for.

The example above shows a simple version of a model using POJOs. As you can see modelling them is pretty simple. The only thing that is needed to to model the classes, their attributes, operations and associations. In order that JEAF Generator detects a domain model they have to be tagged with stereotype `«POJO»`. That’s all.

As described in [General Behavior of JEAF Generator](/developer-guide/general-behavior/) access methods for attributes and associations do not have to be modeled explicitly. They will be generated by JEAF Generator by default.
