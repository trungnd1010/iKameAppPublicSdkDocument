# How to model Domain Objects

Domain objects (stereotype `«DomainObject»`) are used to define the internal structure of a component. Domain objects are intended to be used to represent the domain model of a component when it does not need persistence or if a strict separation 
between persistence and domain objects is expected.

The example above shows a simple version of such a domain model. As you can see modelling domain objects is pretty simple. The only thing that is needed to to model the classes, their attributes, operations and associations. In order that JEAF Generator detects a domain model they have to be tagged with stereotype `«DomainObject»`. That’s all.

As described in [General Behavior of JEAF Generator](/developer-guide/general-behavior/) access methods for attributes and associations do not have to be modeled explicitly. They will be generated by JEAF Generator by default.
