# JEAF Generator Meta Model

## Extension of UML Standard Meta Model

As described [in the introduction](../model-driven-software-development) the UML standard model is not meaningful enough to express everything that is needed for model driven software development. However UML defines a standard compliant way to extend its meta model. Therefore UML allows to define custom stereotypes.

Hereinafter all of JEAF’s extensions to the UML standard meta model will be called **“JEAF Generator Meta Model (JMM)”**.
