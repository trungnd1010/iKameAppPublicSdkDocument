# Stereotype `«JEAFDeprecated»`
Deprecations are markers that indicate that a specific model element should not be used any longer. To do so, you just have to apply the stereotype `«JEAFDeprecated»` to the model element. This can be anything from a whole class or interface to an parameter of an operation.

| **Stereotype**          | `«JEAFDeprecated»` | |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | |
| **Applicable Elements** | `Element`        |
| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Name**                | **Type**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `description`   | `String` | Explanation which the element is deprecated and what should be done as an alternative. |
| `since`   | `String` | Information since when a model element is deprecated e.g. a concrete version or data. |
| `removedWith`   | `String` | Information when the deprecated element will no longer be available e.g. a version or date. |
| `generateBackwardCompatibility`   | `Boolean` | JEAF Generator supports developers ensuring backward compatibility of deprecations on Java and JSON level. <br><br>This mechanism has to be activated for each deprecation separately using this flag. In addition the name of the successor property has to be provided using tag `successorName`. |
| `successorName`   | `String` | Name of the property that should be used instead of this one. Setting this value is only required in case that you want backward compatibility to be generated. |
