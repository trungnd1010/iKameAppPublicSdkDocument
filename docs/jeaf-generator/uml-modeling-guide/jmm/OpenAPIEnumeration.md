# Stereotype `«OpenAPIEnumeration»`
Stereotype `«OpenAPIEnumeration»` can be used to mark an enumeration to be part of an OpenAPI specification.

JEAF Generator also supports so called "extensible enums". From a semantic versioning perspective added new literals to an enumeration is a breaking change. However in reality this is a quite common case. If you want to avoid the breaking change then you can work with extensible enums. By convention for them its not considered to be a breaking change if you add an additional literal.

To support developers in this scenarios JEAF Generator is able to generate extensible enums. In such a case type `x-extensible-enum` is used instead of `enum`.

| **Tagged Values**       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `extensibleEnum`   | `Boolean` | If set to `true` the enumeration is an extensible enum.<br><br>Default value: `false` |
| `hasDynamicLiterals`   | `Boolean` | Typically enumeration literals are directly defined on an enumeration in the UML model. However, there might be cases where the literals should be resolved from somewhere else.<br><br>For such cases JEAF Generator allows to dynamically resolve literals. Therefore, in addition to setting this tag to `true` also  `jeafgenerator/api/OpenAPIEnumExtensionPoint.ext` has to be implemented. There the dynamic literals have to be returned by function `List[String] getDynamicLiteralNames(JMM::OpenAPIEnumeration enum)`.<br><br>It is also supported to mix model defined and dynamic literals. |
