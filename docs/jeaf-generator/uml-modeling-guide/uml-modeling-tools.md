# UML Modeling Tools

Unfortunately many so called UML Modeling Tools are just better tools for painting, but not sufficient to create real UML models. Sadly even tools like Enterprise Architect that are widely used, do not have full support for the UML meta model.

This leads to the situation that even though JEAF Generator only makes use of UML standard features only a few UML Modeling Tool are currently supported. Our recommended tool is called <a href="https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/no-magic/magicdraw" target="_blank">MagicDraw UML</a>. Besides the full support for the UML meta model it also is the only tool that we can recommend to be used in enterprise class projects as it is one of the few ones that has strong support for team work and branching.

For further information about how to use MagicDraw UML in combination with JEAF Generator please have a look on the following pages:

- [How to setup MagicDraw UML Projects](../setup-magic-draw-projects)

- [Export UML Model from MagicDraw UML](../magic-draw-xmi-export)

## Eclipse Papyrus

Besides MagicDraw UML also <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/" target="_blank">Eclipse Papyrus</a> can be used in combination with JEAF Generator. Even though itâ€™s feature set is reduced compared to MagicDraw UML it might be an interesting alternative as it if free of charge.
